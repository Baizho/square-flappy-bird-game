# SquareGame

A browser‑based square‑movement game similiar to flappy bird built as a learning project.

## Description  
SquareGame‑Web is a simple interactive web game in which the player controls a square character navigating a 2D grid while avoiding obstacles. Developed to explore core web game mechanics, this project demonstrates the foundational use of HTML5 canvas, JavaScript game loops, and basic collision detection.

## Features Implemented  
- Player-controlled square movement using keyboard input  
- Dynamic generation of obstacles.
- Real-time collision detection between player and obstacles.
- Score tracking and simple game‑over state  
- Responsive canvas resizing to fit browser window  
- Minimalistic UI to display score and game‑over screen  

## Tech Stack  
- HTML5 (Canvas)  
- CSS3  
- JavaScript (ES6+)  
- No external game libraries — built from scratch for learning purposes  
- Optional local web server (e.g., Live Server) for development  

## Note  
> **This is a practice/demo/learning project.**  
> The project was created to practice and demonstrate game‑loop architecture, canvas rendering, event handling, and collision logic.  
> No further updates or maintenance are planned — the code is retained here as an archival finished work for portfolio purposes.
